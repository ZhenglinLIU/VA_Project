But now the word\r\nis out and the people are running, not walking, to buy up their claim on\r\nthis bit of paradise!\r\nAnticipating rapid growth, the city of Engagement, Ohio USA is doing\r\na participatory urban planning exercise to understand the current state\r\nof the city and identify opportunities for future growth. About 1000\r\nrepresentative residents in this modest-sized city have agreed to\r\nprovide data using the city’s urban planning app, which records the\r\nplaces they visit, their spending, and their purchases, among other\r\nthings. From these volunteers, the city will have data to assist with\r\ntheir major community revitalization efforts, including how to allocate\r\na very large city renewal grant they have recently received.\r\n1.2 Motivation\r\nEconomic considers the financial health of the city. Over time, are\r\nbusinesses growing or shrinking? How are people changing jobs? Are\r\nstandards of living improving or declining over time?\r\nIn this project, based on VAST Challenge\r\n2022, considering the financial status of Engagement’s\r\nbusinesses and residents, we decide to dig into the economic situation\r\nof the Engagement city and use visual analytic techniques to address\r\nthese questions.\r\n2. Data Source\r\nDatasets were obtained from the VAST Challenge\r\n2022 official website in csv format. Datasets required for this\r\nchallenge are including, but not limited to:\r\nParticipants.csv\r\nFinancialJournal.csv\r\nPubs.csv\r\nRestaurants.csv\r\nCheckinJournal.csv\r\n3.

We can observe the prosperity of various industries through\r\nthe consumption proportion of residents in all aspects in this research\r\nperiod.\r\nData\r\nWe need to extract residents’ consumption in different aspects from\r\nthe FinancialJournal.csv, and get the insight by\r\ncalculating monthly income and expense.\r\nSkeleton\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\nknitr::include_graphics(\"C:/Users/iphone/VA_Project/images/q1_Expense.jpg\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVisualization 2:\r\nTarget\r\nFor restaurants and pubs, revenue and number of customers can reflect\r\nthe prosperity of these two industries.\r\nData\r\nWe need to use TravelJournal.csv to calculate the\r\nconsumption amount in Restaurant and Pub, and then get the insight of\r\nbusiness development situation.\r\nSkeleton\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\nknitr::include_graphics(\"C:/Users/iphone/VA_Project/images/q1_respubRevenue.jpg\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.2 Question 2:\r\nResidents’ Financial Health\r\nHow does the financial health of the residents change over the\r\nperiod covered by the dataset?\r\nHow do wages compare to the overall cost of living in\r\nEngagement?\r\nAre there groups that appear to exhibit similar patterns?\r\nVisualization 1:\r\nTarget\r\nHigher incomes or higher balances mean that people have more money to\r\nspend, and more a higher consumption on recreation means that are more\r\nlikely to enjoy life.
