ABOUT US\r\n6. Future Work\r\n\r\n1. Overview\r\nA detailed introduction of the projects, including background,\r\nmotivation, data, tasks and related visualizations.\r\n2. USER GUIDE\r\nA general introduction to this website and each html document.\r\n3. App\r\nA Shinny Application that provide more interactive visual\r\nexperience.\r\nQuestion 1\r\nOver the period covered by the dataset, which businesses appear to be\r\nmore prosperous? Which appear to be struggling? Describe your rationale\r\nfor your answers.\r\nAnswer 1\r\nProsperous and struggling business based on households’\r\nexpense\r\nPath: App -> Prosperous and Struggling Business -> Total\r\nExpense over Time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] By selecting the drop-down list, we can add or delete different\r\nexpense category in the table, to compare and observe the expenditure\r\ntrend in each aspect.\r\n[2] By hanging over each points we can get more details of the\r\ncategory and consuming amount in this category in corresponding\r\nmonth.\r\nAnswer 2\r\nRevenue during specific period to compare the prosperity of\r\npub and restaurant industries\r\nPath: App -> Prosperous and Struggling Business -> Business\r\nRevenue over Time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] By selecting from the drop-down list of the start time and end\r\ntime, we can determine which period to take a closer look to understand\r\nthe prosperity of this two industries.\r\nAnswer 3\r\nMonthly revenue trend for each pub/restaurant\r\nPath: App -> Prosperous and Struggling Business -> Pubs\r\nRevenue/Restaurant Revenue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] By selecting from the Pub ID drop-down options, we can add or\r\nremove pub or restaurant IDs that we want to explore.\r\n[5] We can choose start time and end time to visualize the trend.\r\n[6] We can get access to more details of selected ID in areas under\r\nthe visualization plot.\r\nQuestion 2\r\nHow does the financial health of the residents change over the period\r\ncovered by the dataset? How do wages compare to the overall cost of\r\nliving in Engagement? Are there groups that appear to exhibit similar\r\npatterns?\r\nAnswer 1\r\nFinancial health of the residents change over the\r\nperiod\r\nWage/balance and other financial categories change over the\r\nperiod\r\nPath: App -> Financial Health of Residents -> Calculated\r\nFinancial Index Change by Time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] By selecting different category- “Expense”, “Income”, “Balance”\r\nor other expenditure on “Food” or “Recreation” etc., we can observe the\r\ntrend respectively during this 15 months.\r\nMonthly expense in different categories\r\nPath: App -> Financial Health of Residents -> Total Monthly\r\nExpense\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] By selecting from the drop-down list, we can select the category\r\nfor expenditure to plot the bar chart.\r\n[3] Hanging over the graph we can get the detailed time and consuming\r\namount at corresponding point.\r\nUsing Lorenz Curve to show wealth distribution\r\nPath: App -> Financial Health of Residents -> Lorenz Curve\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] By selecting “Total Earning”, “Total Saving” and “Total Expense”,\r\nfrom the side bar, the Lorenz curve will be shown respectively.\r\n[5] For example, we can observe that 50% of the people control 25% of\r\nthe income and the other 75% income dominated by the other 50%\r\nresidents, which shows income inequality. For Total Saving, this balance\r\nis even more obvious. You can select “Total Saving” from the drop-down\r\nlist.\r\nAnswer 2\r\nWages compare with the overall cost of living\r\nExpenditure/Income rate\r\nPath: App -> Financial Health of Residents -> Wage Compare with\r\nCost Of Living\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[6] By hanging over the chart, we can access to more details of time\r\nand rate.\r\nDistribution of wage and expense\r\nPath: App -> Financial Health of Residents -> Wage Compare with\r\nCost of Living Monthly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[7] By selecting expenditure category side bar, we can easily observe\r\nthe relationship between expenditure on different category and monthly\r\nincome.And the color is based on the category, in other words, the\r\nparticipants education level/interest group. And the color shade\r\nrepresents the month.\r\nAnswer 3\r\nResidents’ financial health patterns\r\nDensity plot of financial category of different group\r\nPath: App -> Financial Health of Residents -> Density\r\nDistribution of Residents’ Monthly Financial Category\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[8] By selecting from the category bar, we can choose\r\nbalance/income/expense as x axis and get the density line of\r\ncorresponding category.\r\n[9] By selecting from character side bar, we can choose different\r\nvariable such as education level to show the distinct character group\r\ndensity line using different color.\r\n[10] Hanging over to know the density, category and character\r\ndetail.\r\nStatistical box plot of financial category of different group\r\nPath: App -> Financial Health of Residents -> Monthly Financial\r\nCategory with Characters\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[11] Selecting from the category side bar to determine which category\r\nto visualize and reflect in X axis.\r\n[12] Selecting from the character side bar to determine which\r\ncharacter to visualize and reflect different group in Y axis.\r\nA combination (3 factors) of different financial category, residents\r\ncharacters to show financial patterns in scatter plot.\r\nPath: App -> Financial Health of Residents -> Financial Pattern\r\nScatter Plot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[13] X axis drop-down list is numeric data- age/joviality.\r\n[14] Y axis drop-down is the financial category, including but not\r\nlimited to wage, food, recreation, balance and balance.\r\n[15] Fill drop-down is the residents’ character group, different\r\ncolor represents different group. By clicking on the variable on the\r\nlegend, we are able to remove or add different group data from the plot,\r\nso that to avoid overcrowded data on the graph and help to compare\r\ninteractively between different groups.\r\nQuestion 3\r\nDescribe the health of the various employers within the city limits.\r\nWhat employment patterns do you observe? Do you notice any areas of\r\nparticularly high or low turnover?\r\nAnswer 1\r\nThe health of the various employer\r\nIn tree map, employers’ employee size represented by the shape, the\r\nsalary level represented by the shade.\r\nPath: App -> Health of Employers -> Number of Employees Hired\r\nby Employers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We can select different years and months by drop-down\r\noptions.\r\n[2] The shape area represents the number of employer having same\r\namount of employee.We can observe that in the selected period, employers\r\nwho have 5 employees take up the maximum proportion, and among them\r\nemployer ID 429 provides the highest monthly wage.\r\n[3] The shade represents the monthly salary, the darker, the higher\r\nsalary. Employer Id 848 offer the highest salary in this month.\r\nAnswer 2\r\nEmployment patterns\r\nThe influence of education level to salary\r\nPath: App -> Health of Employers -> Job Salary by Different\r\nEducation Level\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] We can observe that for employer with different education level\r\nrequirements, the salary distribution varies. By dragging the bar, we\r\ncan take a closer looker into the density difference in different\r\nsalary.\r\nAnswer 3\r\nTurnover\r\nTurnover frequency according to different employee group: Education\r\nlevel, Working days in weekends, Interest group\r\nPath: App -> Health of Employers -> Job Turnover\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[5] Turnover rate varies from job requirements of different interest\r\ngroup, different education level and working on weekends. By selecting\r\ndifferent category from the drop-down list, we can detect different\r\npatterns of employment.\r\n4.

Future Work\r\nIn order to better illustrate the prosperity of various industry,\r\nmore data on the profitability, cost rate and growth scale of different\r\nbusiness are needed.\r\nMore detailed data are needed to support the exploration of\r\nresidents’ financial health and employers’ financial Health, so as to\r\nfurther explore the impact of different factors on living standards and\r\neconomic levels.\r\nDue to time and shinny application skills limitation, some other\r\nvisualization methods have not been tried. More insight can be gained by\r\nimproving the visualization methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Application\r\n6. Reference\r\n\r\n1. Project Overview\r\n1.1 Background\r\nIn Engagement, Ohio, the future is now! For years this sleepy bedroom\r\ncommunity was a secret gem in the heart of the state. But now the word\r\nis out and the people are running, not walking, to buy up their claim on\r\nthis bit of paradise!\r\nAnticipating rapid growth, the city of Engagement, Ohio USA is doing\r\na participatory urban planning exercise to understand the current state\r\nof the city and identify opportunities for future growth. About 1000\r\nrepresentative residents in this modest-sized city have agreed to\r\nprovide data using the city’s urban planning app, which records the\r\nplaces they visit, their spending, and their purchases, among other\r\nthings. From these volunteers, the city will have data to assist with\r\ntheir major community revitalization efforts, including how to allocate\r\na very large city renewal grant they have recently received.\r\n1.2 Motivation\r\nEconomic considers the financial health of the city. Over time, are\r\nbusinesses growing or shrinking? How are people changing jobs? Are\r\nstandards of living improving or declining over time?\r\nIn this project, based on VAST Challenge\r\n2022, considering the financial status of Engagement’s\r\nbusinesses and residents, we decide to dig into the economic situation\r\nof the Engagement city and use visual analytic techniques to address\r\nthese questions.\r\n2. Data Source\r\nDatasets were obtained from the VAST Challenge\r\n2022 official website in csv format. Datasets required for this\r\nchallenge are including, but not limited to:\r\nParticipants.csv\r\nFinancialJournal.csv\r\nPubs.csv\r\nRestaurants.csv\r\nCheckinJournal.csv\r\n3. Methodology\r\nThe following are the packages required for this challenge, including\r\nbut not limited to:\r\ntidyverse: are designed to work together to make common data\r\nscience operations more user friendly. The packages have functions for\r\ndata wrangling, tidying, reading/writing, parsing, and visualizing,\r\namong others.\r\nlubridate: fast and user friendly parsing of date-time data,\r\nextraction and updating of components of a date-time (years, months,\r\ndays, hours, minutes, and seconds), algebraic manipulation on date-time\r\nand time-span objects\r\nggiraph: a tool that allows you to create dynamic ggplot graphs.\r\nThis allows you to add tooltips, hover effects and JavaScript actions to\r\nthe graphics. The package also allows the selection of graphical\r\nelements when used in shiny applications.\r\ngganimate: extends the grammar of graphics as implemented by\r\nggplot2 to include the description of animation.\r\nggstatsplot: to provide statistical details\r\n4. Proposed Visualization\r\n4.1 Question 1: Business\r\nSituation\r\nOver the period covered by the dataset, which businesses appear to\r\nbe more prosperous? Which appear to be struggling?\r\nVisualization 1:\r\nTarget\r\nHousehold consumption can reflect the prosperity of various\r\nindustries. We can observe the prosperity of various industries through\r\nthe consumption proportion of residents in all aspects in this research\r\nperiod.\r\nData\r\nWe need to extract residents’ consumption in different aspects from\r\nthe FinancialJournal.csv, and get the insight by\r\ncalculating monthly income and expense.\r\nSkeleton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVisualization 2:\r\nTarget\r\nFor restaurants and pubs, revenue and number of customers can reflect\r\nthe prosperity of these two industries.\r\nData\r\nWe need to use TravelJournal.csv to calculate the\r\nconsumption amount in Restaurant and Pub, and then get the insight of\r\nbusiness development situation.\r\nSkeleton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.2 Question 2:\r\nResidents’ Financial Health\r\nHow does the financial health of the residents change over the\r\nperiod covered by the dataset?\r\nHow do wages compare to the overall cost of living in\r\nEngagement?\r\nAre there groups that appear to exhibit similar patterns?\r\nVisualization 1:\r\nTarget\r\nHigher incomes or higher balances mean that people have more money to\r\nspend, and a higher consumption on recreation means that people are more\r\nlikely to enjoy life. So, financial Health can be shown by monthly wage\r\nor monthly total/average balance.\r\nTo better observe the financial health of this city, lorenz curve\r\nalso will be used.\r\nData\r\nWe need to use FinancialJournal.csv to calculate the\r\nexpense, income and balance respectively to visualize the trend during\r\nthis period.\r\nSkeleton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVisualization 2:\r\nTarget\r\nBy plotting each individual’s income/expense/balance, we can better\r\nevaluate each residents’ financial health.\r\nData\r\nOriginal FinancialJournal.csv with participant ID\r\nwill be used, similarly, to calculate the expense, income and balance\r\nrespectivelyfor each candidates.\r\nSkeleton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVisualization 3:\r\nPurpose\r\nHow is the expense distributed during this period? Is expenditure on\r\nrecreation/food increase? Expenditure is another way to understand the\r\nfinancial health and people’s living standard .\r\nData\r\nExpenditure indifferent aspect need to be filtered out to show the\r\nfinancial situation.\r\nSkeleton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVisualization 4:\r\nPurpose\r\nHow do wages compare to the overall cost of living in Engagement? One\r\nway to compare is get the coefficient of expenditure and income, another\r\nway is to visualize the scatter plot in each month to observe the\r\ndistribution of income and expense.\r\nData\r\nHere, we can calculate the line graph of coefficient- total expense\r\ndivided by total income.\r\nSkeleton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVisualization 5:\r\nPurpose\r\nPeople’s spend and earning pattern may vary from different interest\r\ngroup, education level , age group and joviality level. There are many\r\ngraph can help to understand better of these patterns, for example,\r\nscatter plot to show the distribution of residents’ expense and income\r\nin different age. We need to try multiple tables to see which one can\r\ngive us a better result.\r\nData\r\nIn addition to participants.csv,\r\nParticipant.csv also need to be combined to look into\r\nfinancial patterns.\r\nSkeleton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.3 Question 3:\r\nEmployer/ Employement Situation\r\nDescribe the health of the various employers within the city\r\nlimits.\r\nWhat employment patterns do you observe?\r\nAny areas of particularly high or low turnover?\r\nVisulization 1:\r\nPurpose\r\nTo know the health of the various employers, we need to know\r\ndifferent employers’ employee size, which can be represented by the\r\nshape in tree map; we need to know the salary level of each employer,\r\nwhich can be represented by the shade of the tree map.\r\nThe larger the size, the more employer have the same size of\r\nemployees; the darker the shade, the higher the hourly salary.\r\nData\r\nWe will use ActivityLogs.csv to identify job\r\ncategory, and then join with job.csv by job Id to get\r\nthe hourly salary that represented by the shade. The joined dataset need\r\nto join with Employer.csv to acquire the number of\r\nemployees that represented by the shape.\r\nSkeleton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVisulization 2:\r\nPurpose\r\nDifferent requirement of education level may implies different\r\nsalary, it’s one aspect of the employment pattern.\r\nData\r\nTo observe the employment pattern regarding requirement to employees’\r\neducation level, Job.csv is utilised to acquire data of\r\neducation requirement in different employer.\r\nSkeleton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVisulization 3:\r\nPurpose\r\nRegarding to the areas of particularly high or low turnover, we may\r\nexplore whether education level requirements affect the turnover rate,\r\nwhether working days within one week or working frequency in weekends\r\naffect the turnover.\r\nData\r\nFirst, ActivityLogs.csv is used to calculate the\r\ntimes each one changing a job in this period, then combine with\r\nJobs.csv to show the relationship between the turnover\r\nfrequency and education level requirement as well as working days in\r\nweekends.\r\nSkeleton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.
