```

[1] By selecting different category- "Expense", "Income", "Balance" or other expenditure on "Food" or "Recreation" etc., we can observe the trend respectively during this 15 months.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/iphone/VA_Project/images/app/q2_lorenz.jpg")
```

[2] By selecting  "Total Earning", "Total Saving" and "Total Expense", The Lorenz curve will be shown respectively.

[3] For example, 50%t of the people control 25% of the income and the other 75% income dominated by the other 50% residents, which shows income inequality. For Total Saving, this balance is even more obvious. You can select "Total Saving" from the drop-down list.

[2] The shape area represents the number of employer having same amount of employee.We can observe that in the selected period, employers who have 5 employees take up the maximum proportion, and among them employer ID 429 provides the highest monthly wage.

[3] The shade represents the monthly salary, the darker, the higher salary. Employer Id 848 offer the highest salary in this month.


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/iphone/VA_Project/images/app/q3_densityEdu.jpg")
```

[4] We can observe that for employer with different education level requirements, the salary distribution varies. By dragging the bar, we can take a closer looker into the density difference in different salary.


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/iphone/VA_Project/images/app/q3_barEmployementPattern.jpg")
```

[5] Turnover rate varies from job requirements of different interest group, different education level and working on weekends. By selecting different category from the drop-down list, we can detect different patterns of employment.
